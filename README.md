# CSharpHashMap

This project contains a C# console application that finds the majority element in an array using a hash map (dictionary) approach. A majority element is defined as an element that appears more than n/2 times in the array.

## Description

The application includes various edge cases to test the `FindNumber` method, which identifies the majority element in an array. The edge cases include empty arrays, single element arrays, arrays with all elements the same, arrays with no majority element, arrays with negative numbers, and more.


## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BarryFourie/CSharpHashMap.git


1. Navigate to the project:

   ```sh
